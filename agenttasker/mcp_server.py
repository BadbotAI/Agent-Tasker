"""MCP server exposing AgentTasker tools over stdio.

Run with `agenttasker mcp` (requires the 'mcp' extra: pip install 'agenttasker[mcp]').
The server resolves its project from its working directory (or $AGENTTASKER_PROJECT),

_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""\
AgentTasker: a persistent, local, project-namespaced task board shared by agents and humans.

Workflow contract:
1. Capture work as tasks (`add_task`) before doing it. Break big asks into small tasks.
2. Record evidence/analysis in `evidence` BEFORE moving a task to in_progress.
3. Claim a task by setting status to in_progress; work it; set to in_review when done;
   set to done once verified.
4. Declare dependencies (`depends_on`) and external blockers (`blockers`) as soon as
   known, and clear them when resolved.
5. Use list_tasks(ready=True) to pick up work and list_tasks(blocked=True) to surface
   stuck work. Do not let tasks silently stall.

Statuses (board order): {", ".join(STATUSES)}.
Tasks are namespaced per project; reference them as '<id>' or '<project>-<id>'.
The same data is viewable by humans via `agenttasker board` (TUI) or `agenttasker ls` (CLI).
